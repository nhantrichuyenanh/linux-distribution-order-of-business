## [Windows 11](https://github.com/nhantrichuyenanh/win-11-ofb "nhantrichuyenanh")
It's for everyone, from the casual home user to the office user to the competitive gamer to an IT admin. So everyone's experience using Windows 11 is relatively the same. In addition, many corporations use it, so it has to be backward compatible with old software. Because Windows 11 has to accommodate many needs, it's often unstable and buggy.

So it's no surprise Windows is known for having its fair share of downsides:
- **Major**:
  - bloatware and ads everywhere
  - telemetry and spyware kicks in as soon as you connect to the internet  
  - resource hungry even at idle state  
  - limited UI customization
  - dark mode inconsistency
  - not completely free, requiring product key  
- **Minor**:
  - unnecessary preinstalled system/administrative tools only technical users use  
  - legacy components like *Phone and Modem (from Windows 95/98)*, and *Windows Problem Reporting* for example
  - half-baked Settings, frequently redirecting to Control Panel dialogs for advanced configurations <sup>though Microsoft is making strides in migrating them to Settings</sup>
  - feature duplications such as *Disk Cleanup* - *Storage Sense*, *Run dialog* - *Windows Search*, [MSRT](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_Software_Removal_Tool) - *Windows Defender*, etc...  

All of these drawbacks can be fixed with third-party tools.

## GNU/Linux
Meanwhile, some distros are for newly migrated users from Windows, some for competitive gamers, and some for power users, each with different desktop environments. So everyone's experience using GNU/Linux is vastly different. In addition, many corporations use it for their servers, so it has to be lightweight.

- Because GNU/Linux (Unix-like) is extremely diverse and fundamentally different from Windows (MS-DOS), it can be challenging to fully embrace it, such as:
  - navigating desktop environments
  - understanding concepts like *package managers* and [FHS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard "Wikipedia")
  - doing common activities like installing/uninstalling apps and updating system via the terminal emulator
  - learning system and admin tools that comes preinstalled or needed to be installed

- I still use Windows 11 on my PC because:
  - I have to research which distro to pick and which alternative to download should software isn't available on Linux
  - installing distro, configuring, setting up, and installing software takes up so much time, effort, patience and willpower
  - all the hotkeys, directory structure, system applications, OS security, and GUI on Linux are radically different to Windows
  - I don't want to deal with driver issues on Linux, which is so time-consuming to diagnose and fix
  - it is fixable, so why bother switching to GNU/Linux in the first place?

P.S. I successfully installed **Arch Linux (Cinnamon)** on an old 2007 DELL laptop, but didn't on a 2013 SONY one. So for the latter, I installed **Linux Mint**, which was successful but it ran painfully slow, so I ultimately installed **EndeavourOS (KDE Plasma)**.
