# Linux distribution Order of Business
Windows is abysmal to the point where I'm writing this in case I ever need to migrate to GNU/Linux once and for all.

## Major downsides of Windows 11
- forced updates
- automatically (re)enable/install telemetry, bloatware, etc... after update installation  
- bloatware and ads everywhere from File Explorer, Settings, Start Menu, to even occasional notifications  
- telemetry and spyware kicks in as soon as you connect to the internet  
- resource hungry even at idle state  
- limited UI customization and dark mode inconsistency in legacy menu like Control Panel and File Explorer pop-ups  
- not completely free, requiring product key  

## Minor downsides of Windows 11
- unnecessary system/administrative tools such as Event Viewer, Reliability Monitor, and Task Scheduler only technical users like sysadmin use  
- legacy components like Phone and Modem (from Windows 95/98), Windows Problem Reporting, and XP-era icons pulled from Shell32.dll  
- half-baked Settings, frequently redirecting to Control Panel dialogs for advanced configurations (though Microsoft is making strides in migrating them to Settings)  
- feature duplications such as Disk Cleanup - Storage Sense, Run dialog - Windows Search, [MSRT](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_Software_Removal_Tool) - Windows Defender, etc...

All of these can be fixed with third-party tools. If one day they don't work anymore, I'll jump ship and write a guide for this repo. **Windows enshittification is real and it's happening as I write this.** The only real downside of GNU/Linux from a long-time Windows user's perspective is learning and getting used to using Linux, such as:
- navigating desktop environments  
- understanding concepts like package managers and filesystem hierarchy  
- common activities like installing/uninstalling apps and updating system  
- locating and/or installing and learning the various system and admin tools  

Here're some websites to get started:

- **Windows to Linux for Powerusers**: [christitus.com/windows-to-linux](https://christitus.com/windows-to-linux)

P.S. I successfully installed **Arch Linux (Cinnamon)** on an old 2007 DELL laptop, but didn't on a 2013 SONY one. So for the latter, I installed **Linux Mint**, which was successful but it ran painfully slow, so I ultimately installed **EndeavourOS (KDE Plasma)**. It took only time, patience, and willpower.
